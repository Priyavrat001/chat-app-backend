## Backend of Real-Time Chat Application

### Description
The backend of our Real-Time Chat Application is built to provide robust, scalable, and secure server-side functionality, ensuring a seamless and reliable user experience. Utilizing Express and a range of powerful dependencies, the backend handles everything from real-time communication to data storage and user authentication.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using bcrypt for password hashing and jsonwebtoken for token-based authentication.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.io is used to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients, facilitating instant messaging and live updates.
- **Data Storage:** Mongoose is used to interact with MongoDB, providing a flexible and efficient way to manage user data, messages, and multimedia files.
- **File Uploads:** Multer handles file uploads, allowing users to share photos, videos, and other files seamlessly.
- **Multimedia Management:** Cloudinary is integrated for storing and delivering multimedia files efficiently.
- **Request Validation:** Express-validator ensures that incoming requests are properly validated and sanitized, enhancing security and data integrity.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** The CORS middleware enables cross-origin requests, ensuring compatibility with frontend applications hosted on different domains.
- **Cookie Parsing:** Cookie-parser is used to parse cookies attached to client requests, aiding in session management and user tracking.
- **Environment Management:** Dotenv is used to manage environment variables, keeping sensitive information secure and configuration flexible.
- **Custom Error Handling Middleware:** Custom middleware is implemented to handle errors gracefully, providing clear feedback and aiding in debugging.
